1. Introduction
The Quantum Consciousness Lab (QCL) is an open-source software platform designed to pioneer the study of consciousness by integrating quantum computing, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. Inspired by quantum theories of consciousness, such as the Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch-OR) model proposed by Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff, QCL provides a comprehensive framework for modeling quantum consciousness metrics, analyzing neuroscientific data (e.g., EEG, fMRI), and enabling real-time applications like Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) and AR/VR visualizations.

QCL addresses the “hard problem of consciousness”—the challenge of explaining subjective experience—by facilitating research into quantum processes like superposition, entanglement, and wavefunction collapse that may underpin consciousness. Released under the MIT License with a written consent clause for commercial use, QCL fosters global collaboration among researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to explore the quantum-neuroscience frontier.

2. Scientific Foundation

2.1 Quantum Theories of Consciousness

Consciousness remains a profound scientific mystery. Classical neuroscience, rooted in neuronal networks and biochemical processes, struggles to fully account for subjective experience. Quantum theories, such as Orch-OR, propose that quantum phenomena in neuronal microtubules—specifically superposition, entanglement, and objective reduction—may play a critical role in consciousness. Emerging evidence of quantum coherence in biological systems, such as photosynthesis, supports the plausibility of quantum processes in the brain’s warm, wet environment.

QCL implements a quantum consciousness metric, \(C(t)\), defined as:

\[
C(t) = \frac{\Phi_{\text{QM}}(t) \cdot \mathcal{E}(t)}{S_{\text{vN}}(t) + \mathcal{N}_{\text{QFT}}(t) + \Gamma_{\text{dec}}(t)}
\]

where:

\(\Phi_{\text{QM}}(t)\): Quantum superposition in microtubules.

\(\mathcal{E}(t)\): Entanglement measure.

\(S_{\text{vN}}(t)\): Von Neumann entropy.

\(\mathcal{N}_{\text{QFT}}(t)\): Quantum Fourier Transform noise.

\(\Gamma_{\text{dec}}(t)\): Decoherence rate.

Additionally, \(C_\Sigma(t)\) integrates \(C(t)\) over time to analyze consciousness dynamics across temporal windows.

2.2 Role of QCL

QCL provides a computational platform to test quantum consciousness hypotheses by simulating quantum processes and analyzing neuroscientific data. It bridges theoretical models with empirical evidence, enabling researchers to investigate how quantum effects may manifest in brain activity.

3. Key Features of QCL

QCL offers a modular suite of tools organized within the models/ directory, supporting a wide range of quantum neuroscience research tasks:
