#  Quantum Consciousness Lab (QCL)

The **Quantum Consciousness Lab (QCL)** is the ultimate open-source platform for advancing consciousness research through quantum mechanics, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. It implements a quantum consciousness metric, \(C(t)\), defined as:

\[
C(t) = \frac{\Phi_{\text{QM}}(t) \cdot \mathcal{E}(t)}{S_{\text{vN}}(t) + \mathcal{N}_{\text{QFT}}(t) + \Gamma_{\text{dec}}(t)},
\]

where:
- \(\Phi_{\text{QM}}(t)\): Quantum superposition measure via density matrix \(\rho(t)\).
- \(\mathcal{E}(t)\): Entanglement measure (Schmidt decomposition).
- \(S_{\text{vN}}(t)\): Von Neumann entropy.
- \(\mathcal{N}_{\text{QFT}}(t)\): Quantum field theory noise.
- \(\Gamma_{\text{dec}}(t)\): Decoherence rate.

The platform extends to \(C_\Sigma(t)\), a time-integrated metric for coherence optimization, and incorporates advanced features such as multi-frequency wave packets, vacuum fluctuations, Error-Related Potentials (ErrP) detection, Active Machine Learning (AML) feedback, and multiple decomposition methods (FFT, wavelet, Hilbert, tensor, Schmidt, PCA). QCL integrates cutting-edge technologies like neuromorphic computing, graph neural networks (GNNs), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), augmented reality (AR)/virtual reality (VR), federated learning, blockchain provenance, and voice control, making it a comprehensive tool for researchers worldwide.

##  Features

### Core Consciousness Modeling
- Computes \(C(t)\) and \(C_\Sigma(t)\) with quantum state optimization using Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs).
- Models quantum superposition (\(\Phi_{\text{QM}}(t)\)) with multi-frequency wave packets derived from EEG band powers.
- Simulates vacuum fluctuations for \(\mathcal{N}_{\text{QFT}}(t)\) using Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT).
- Implements quantum error correction to mitigate decoherence (\(\Gamma_{\text{dec}}(t)\)).

### EEG and BCI Integration
- Advanced EEG processing with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), wavelet transform, Hilbert transform, tensor decomposition, and CNN-based artifact correction.
- Detects Error-Related Potentials (ErrP) in theta band (4-8 Hz) for real-time feedback.
- Supports Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) devices (e.g., OpenBCI) and OpenVibe for real-time streaming.
- Integrates Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) for closed-loop neurofeedback based on \(C_\Sigma(t)\).

### Machine Learning and Optimization
- Classical ML (SVM, RandomForest, XGBoost) and quantum ML (QNN) for EEG and emotion classification.
- Hybrid QNN-XGBoost classifier for robust pattern recognition.
- AML feedback using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA).
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for modeling brain connectivity (WPLI).

### Advanced Visualizations
- Interactive Dash dashboards for EEG time-series, 3D Lorenz/PCA attractors, and decomposition visualizations.
- Lyapunov exponent computation for chaos analysis of brain dynamics.
- Real-time AR/VR streaming to Unity for immersive brain visualization.

### Scalability and Collaboration
- Cloud integration with AWS S3 for data streaming and storage.
- Multi-user collaboration via MongoDB-based sessions.
- Federated learning for privacy-preserving model training.
